# Tempo-estimation-aided-genre-classifiation

This repository contains the implementation of a music genre classifier, tempo estimator, and the modified genre classifier aided by the tempo estimator, developed as part of the Deep Learning for Audio module for the MSc Sound and Music Computing programme at Queen Mary University of London.

Note:
- The provided notebook is designed for Google Colab implementation. Change paths as appropriate.
- The GTZAN dataset used is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzandataset-music-genre-classification. The “genres original” will need to be downloaded and unzipped into ./data/genres original/.
- A fixed seed has been used to ensure a standardised randomisation, so that re-running the notebook gives the same numbers.

More details about the models and approach taken can be found in the report included in this repository.
